# Requires additions to main app config/environment.rb

  config.gem 'delayed_job', :version => '~>2.0.4'

# Notes on delayed_job daemon setup...was failing to start with standard script
# taken from: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/delayed_job/qOxGFWnfdWM
Here are the steps:

1. sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
1. sudo gem install alexvollmer-daemon-spawn
1. Move the old daemons delayed job script out of the way -> mv script/
delayed_job script/delayed_job.daemons
1. Make this your new script/delayed_job: http://gist.github.com/104314

Note: you can have both daemon-spawn and daemons gems installed since
the script/delayed_job determines which one to use...so you can go
back and forth so long as you have the scripts readily available.

Try it out again making sure it writes to the tmp/pids directory ok.
My line looks like this:

RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start

then to check (besides running 'ps'), you can run this:
RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job status

Hope this helps someone else.  And hope someone can compare daemons,
       daemon-spawn, and the delayed_job scripts to see what the culprit
       truly is.
